## üîê Identification, Authentication, and Authorization

| Concept | Description | Example |
|----------|--------------|----------|
| Identification | Claiming an identity | Typing username |

## üîë Authentication Methods

- Knowledge-based: Passwords, PINs
- Possession-based: Smart cards, OTP tokens  
- Inherence-based: Biometrics (fingerprints, face ID)  
- Multifactor Authentication (MFA): Combination of 2 or more above  
- Single Sign-On (SSO): One-time login across multiple systems (e.g., Google or Microsoft SSO)

## üîì Authorization Models
DAC (Discretionary Access Control): Owner decides who can access

MAC (Mandatory Access Control): Access based on classification 1

RBAC (Role-Based Access Control): Permissions assigned to roles

- ABAC (Attribute-Based Access Control): Access based on condition
- Example:

An "HR Manager" role can view employee data, while "Employee" role can only view their own profil

Best Practices

strong, unique unique passwords.

Apply MFA wherever possible.

Review role-based permissions regularly.

Log all authentication and access events.
